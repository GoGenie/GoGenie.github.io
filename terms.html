          <h3 style="font-size: 26px;">Below are our terms of service for users of GoGENIE. </h3>
          <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Terms of Service</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to gogenieapp.com, the website and online service of Genie Staffing Limited (“GoGENIE,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection
            with the service (collectively the “Service”).</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">By accessing or using the Service, or by clicking “I Agree,” or otherwise affirming your intent to be bound by this Agreement, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) and
            to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the GoGENIE’s Privacy Policy, located at http://gogenieapp.com/privacy.html, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. You can review the most current version of
            the Terms of Service at any time at: http://gogenieapp.com/terms.html.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">GoGENIE reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources,
            shall be subject to this Agreement. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service, whether on behalf of a company or on their own individual behalf (“Users”).</p>
          <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 800;">PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL
            BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</p>

          <div style="padding-top: 60px;">
            <div class="container clearfix">
              <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">1. Use of Our Service</h3>
              <h3 style="font-size: 26px;">A. Eligibility</h3>
              <p style="text-align: left;">This is a contract between you and GoGENIE. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with GoGENIE,
                and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. Any use of or access to the Service by anyone under 18 is only permitted with the express written permission of such individual’s
                legal guardian, and, if necessary, you represent and warrant that you have received such permission. The Service is not designed for use by or in connection with anyone under the age of 18, and you accept all responsibility that may arise
                from your use of the Service in connection with any minors. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by GoGENIE.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The Service is designed for use by employers and employees in Hong Kong, except for those other countries expressly supported for the onboarding function as reflected in the Service. Other than for expressly supported international onboarding,
                you are not authorized to use the other features of the Service for employees not located in Hong Kong.</p>
              <h3 style="font-size: 26px;">B. GoGENIE Service</h3>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service solely as permitted by the features of the Service, which may vary by User.
                We reserve all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the WIW Content (as defined below). We may terminate this license or your access to the Service at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>
              <h3 style="font-size: 26px;">C. GoGENIE Accounts</h3>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Your GoGENIE account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open
                a GoGENIE account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind
                the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to GoGENIE with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by
                that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that
                occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify
                GoGENIE immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. GoGENIE will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings on your Profile Settings page. By providing GoGENIE with your email address and/or mobile number, you consent to our using the email address
                and/or mobile number to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address and/or mobile number to send you other messages, such as changes
                to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your Profile Settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding
                updates, improvements, or offers.</p>
              <h3 style="font-size: 26px;">D. Service Rules and Restrictions</h3>

                any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the GoGENIE servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same
                period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that GoGENIE grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy publically available materials from gogenieapp.com for the sole purpose
                of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) uploading, posting, hosting, or transmitting spam, chain letters, SMSs or other
                unsolicited email or messages; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at
                our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents or any code of a destructive nature through the Service; (vii) collecting
                or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation
                with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided
                or authorized by the Service; (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on
                use of the Service or the content therein; (xiii) verbally, physically or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of any other User or any GoGENIE customer, employee, member, or officer; (xiv) reproducing, duplicating,
                copying, selling, reselling or otherwise exploiting any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without the express written permission by GoGENIE; or (xv) modifying, adapting or hacking the Service or modifying
                another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service, GoGENIE, or any other GoGENIE service.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">BY USING THE SERVICE YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT (I) YOU DO NOT WORK FOR A COMPETITOR OF THE COMPANY; AND (II) THAT YOU WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION GAINED FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SITE OR THE SERVICES
                TO A COMPETITOR OF THE COMPANY.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access
                to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for any or no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound
                by this Agreement.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">You are solely responsible for your interactions with other GoGENIE Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. We shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users,
                or for any User’s action or inaction.</p>

                on the Service is referred to as “User Content”). We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by providing or sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to
                allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with your settings and this Agreement. GoGENIE has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.
                The User Content may be viewed or shared with others in accordance with your profile settings and the Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii)

                any information or content that you know is not correct and current or (ix) violates any company, employer or other applicable policy.</p>

                and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement
                will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant
                is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and GoGENIE or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the
                rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. GoGENIE reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. The Mobile Software originates in Hong Kong, and is subject to

                Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store-Sourced Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses
                attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to GoGENIE as provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of

                of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, credit balances, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made. In the event that GoGENIE suspends or terminates your account or

                such as in the case of credit card charge backs, pending successful resolution of the dispute. To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with
                your account, which includes without limitation applicable tax information. If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments
                until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information. Any third-party fees related to returned or cancelled payments due to a contact or payment
                information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Service.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">If you dispute any payment made hereunder, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of such payment or from when you purport such payment would have been due, whichever is earlier. Failure to so notify GoGENIE shall result in
                the waiver by you of any claim relating to such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by GoGENIE. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by GoGENIE or have any effect
                under this Agreement and you shall have no audit rights hereunder. We may withhold any taxes or other amounts from payments due to you as required by law.

                or provision.</p>
